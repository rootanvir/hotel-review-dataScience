1114 Blair St,Hotels & Motels,Silverton,US,Bent Elbow,4,"We really enjoyed ourselves at this nice, classic hotel. Our room, the Bordello Room, is in the front of the building, overlooking the street and has a great view. Room rates are reasonable our room was very clean and comfortably spacious.

1808 S Australian Ave,Hotels,West Palm Beach,US,Doubletree By Hilton West Palm Beach Airport,4,"I usually enjoy my stay at Doubletree, whether it's business or pleasure. This was no exception.

835 S Chestatee St,"Wedding Sites,Hotels,Hotels & Motels,Meeting Facilities",Dahlonega,US,Holiday Inn Express Dahlonega,3,"Had a great time in Dahlonega, the hotel staff was friendly and did a nice job. The breakfast was good, the small eating area made it hard to find a seat on the weekend. Internet was horrible. The hotel is convenient to the shopping area and restaurants."
14585 Duval Rd,"Hotels,Hotel",Jacksonville,US,Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,2,The bathroom had a horrible smell
101 Travel Center Blvd,"Resorts & Vacation Cottages,Hotels,Hotels & Motels,Accommodations & Lodging,Inns,Vacation Packages",Dublin,US,La Quinta Inn & Suites Dublin,5,This hotel is very nice and clean. The breakfast is the best I have had at a hotel breakfast bar. The room were comfortable. The beds are great. We also enjoyed the pool which is indoors. The staff was friendly and helpful.
5610 Vineland Rd,Hotels,Orlando,US,Extended Stay America - Orlando Theme Parks - Vineland Rd.,1,The front desk was great but the cleaning crew was horrible . When we first checked in the room wasn't ready . It was just after 3PM so we decided to come back at around 8:30PM. When we went to the room the linen was full of hair. We called the front desk and they were very accommodating and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed . The hotel is also only 3 floors and it took what felt like forever for the elevator to come. Over 10 minute waiting time on average . They don't have any other elevators and were transporting the garbage on the same elevators as the guests which stunk the elevator up like a garbage disposal. When we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask at the front desk because the room had none and we had to wait for it to be washed because apparently they don't have any clean ones readily available. We will not be staying at this extended stay hotel ever ! It's sad because the front desk staff was extremely nice as well.

The bedding was super nice, room was immaculate, pool and hot tub were very warm, and it was nice and quiet. I normally don't sleep much in a hotel, but ended up sleeping 10 hours straight! Was here for business, but will be bringing my hubby for a nice weekend. Loads of great places to visit in downtown Bay City within walking distance. We live just 60 miles away, but its like a vacation to experience the Hilton touches, and Bay City has lots to offer for dining, entertainment and shopping."

920 N Rampart St,"Hotel,Hotels",New Orleans,US,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,4,"Nice, convenient hotel. Staff was very nice and the breakfast was good.

4021 Union Deposit Rd,Hotels,Harrisburg,US,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,3,"The room smelled horrible...like stale cigarette smoke and mold. Other than the smell, they gave me the handicapped room with a shower that floods the floor. Besides these 2 things, the room was fine. I will never stay here again."
375 Main St,"Hotels,Hotel",Waterville,US,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,5,My girlfriend and I visited Waterville Maine for my birthday and to see some of my family.

14585 Duval Rd,"Hotels,Hotel",Jacksonville,US,Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,5,"I checked out of an Extended Stay in a rush and didn't have many options. I would say I was thoroughly impressed seeing how this was the cheaper of hotels next to the airport. It isn't the best hotel I've ever stayed at but being last minute it is a 5 star compared to what I left. I don't ask for much, relative quietness, clean and a working AC. They made the marks in all departments on top of the bed being extremely comfortable. They do have shuttles to the airport. The breakfast options isn't huge, but you are right next to the outdoor mall with a Cracker Barrel if you are a breakfast person. Only downfall I say is the shower heads need to be upgraded. I would definitely stay here again!"
2007 N Expy,Hotels,Griffin,US,Baymont Inn & Suites Griffin,5,"staff was way out of their description to accommodate my family, even offered a group rate, when entire family arrived, even though no reservations were made, due to the nature of our visit to the city, to support our relatives their in time of bereavement. The breakfast was prepared hot and on time, and once again, the staff displayed no signs of stress and disgust... almost certain, that it was my best hotel experience ever received, even more so, than over the top hotels!"

920 N Rampart St,"Hotel,Hotels",New Orleans,US,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,5,The hotel is very nice and well maintained. The rooms were a bit small but not an issue for me.

375 Main St,"Hotels,Hotel",Waterville,US,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,3,This hotel is located right off the highway. Check in was a little off to the right. I thought the entrance should have been located closer to the check in area. Instead it was in between the hotel and connected function facility.Pros: The room was clean & comfortable. Check out is at NoonCons: The door would not close by itself & the water in the shower backed up.
2700 S Country Club Rd,Hotels,El Reno,US,Days Inn El Reno Ok,1,"The hotel was easy off and on the highway, and reasonably priced, which were our main points for selection. The night clerk was very helpful for our issue. But that doesn't outweigh the huge negative of finding a condom wrapper between the sheets with suspicious spots on the blanket, which led us to believe they had not been changed from a prior guest. Upon my request, both were replaced and we were offered a different room, but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket. Disgusting. If I hadn't booked on line I would have insisted on my money back. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone!"
375 Main St,"Hotels,Hotel",Waterville,US,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,4,"overall an 8, breakfast was acceptable (better last few times before) upgraded cable service would make stay much better. matress on both double beds on third floor way too soft but had no problems with 1st ir second floors at earlier stays."
105 Melcon Ln,"Hotels & Motels,Lodging,Hotels And Motels",London,US,Econo Lodge,3,The place is clean and the breakfast is OK continental. The towels are very thin. They need to get new towels.

14585 Duval Rd,"Hotels,Hotel",Jacksonville,US,Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,2,"Less than expected. Not impressed,..pictures online are deceiving. Wide angled lense shots to make room look bigger. It's a shoe box. Bigger than a salt box but not by much! If I wasn't careful I could knock my knees against the a/c unit. About a foot of space between a/c unit on one side and wall on other. Tiny. Front entrance and food area is just as misleading. My husband was fixing coffee and I saw a baby roach come out from sugar packet area and went under coffee machine. Don't expect a lot. It is truly NO FRILLS."

4021 Union Deposit Rd,Hotels,Harrisburg,US,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,2,"From the outside this appears to be a newer property, however the rooms were both worn and dirty. The light in my bathroom would not turn off, the rugs had not been vacuumed and the bed was way past it's useful life. The two co workers traveling with me expressed similar concerns, so this appears to be more than just a problem with one room."

457 Mountain Village Blvd,Hotels,Telluride,US,Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort,3,"The lodge room was spartan with no desk or shelf area nor chair. If you wanted to watch TV you had to lay or seat on the bed. Using the coffee maker was impossible since on the sink was the only location adding risk if you were trying to get ready (teeth, etc) at the same time. There is a nook in the room which a shelf could easily be added for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink. In addition there is room for a chair in the room and would be easy to provide a lap desk (board to be placed on lap for laptop, etc). If you are going to use room as individual hotel room these should be a minimum since the main room is not available. I asked the front desk to have maintenance unlock the safe (locked shut by previous tenants) and they logged the request. Reminded them each morning and never done...on checkout the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished. In addition requested a temporary chair but never delivered. Front desk staff was great and did their job but beyond that nothing happened. Overall staff at desk, restaurant, and housekeeping were friendly and did an outstanding job. Expensive for such a poorly equipped room."

Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area."

However, if you are expecting anything else, this place is lacking. When we arrived there was no one at the desk. After we stood there for a couple of minutes someone shouted out that they would be there in a minute. The staff was not rude but I would say they were indifferent. We went up to our room and my brother and his family went to his. Our room was ok however, my brother had to immediately return to the desk and have his room switched. When he entered the original room the beds were not on their frames and it looked like the furniture was being moved around. His new room had no towels. The front desk informed us that they were out of towels. The pool water was a freezing but the room was 100 degrees. There were no towels at the pool either. We were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning. The shower squealed when it was on and went from extremely hot to freezing. This was tons of fun with children who were trying to shower. The carpet in the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting. I know they never vacuumed it because we were there for 2 nights and it never got cleaned. As other reviews have stated breakfast was nothing to brag about. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again. For an extra couple of we could have stayed at the Econo Lodge right next door. It is a much nicer hotel."

If we wanted anything to eat we would have had to drive into town. We had just driven 8 hours and it was snowing, so that wasn't something we wanted to do. Our room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door if it was family. Since we didn't have family the door remained locked, but we could hear all the conversations, music and TV thru the door cracks. Coffee maker is stored under the sink in the bathroom. If you want to use it, you have to remove everything from the VERY SMALL counter space that is there. There is NO counter space in the room, only 4 drawers. View was nice from the windows, shower was nice. I requested a queen size bed, and got a double bed. My husband is 6'2 and his feet were hanging over the edge. Bed and mattress needed upgrading. Might be great for skiers who just want to ski and crash and not have any amenities or comfort. Even the main lodge had no where to sit and be comfy, as it was dark and had workmen in there cleaning.

16530 Northcross Dr,Hotels,Huntersville,US,Candlewood Suites Huntersville,4,"We chose to stay in Huntersville on our trip to NC because it had easy access to the local highways. The Candlewood Suites was clean and the staff was friendly. They only clean the rooms every 7 days, which was fine for us. However, if you needed anything, you could contact the Front Desk staff and they would accommodate you. There was no breakfast served because all of the rooms are equipped with a full kitchen and stocked with plates, silverware, etc. There is a mini-market in the lobby where you could purchase items by charging to your room or pay by cash. The room was clean, but smaller than I thought. There isn't a living room area, but one recliner in the corner, so I wouldn't necessarily consider that a suite but it was fine for the amount of time that we spent in the room. Also, our room was on the 1st floor facing the parking lot, so we could not open our curtains to let any light in or else everyone from the parking lot could see into our room. Something to consider when booking a room here. Overall, I would recommend this hotel."

I am sure he told a lie. 2) The room had very bad smell. It was like human's odor. 3) Near the hotel, some construction was going on, I guess. They made loud noise from 6-7 am. I could not sleep well. 4) On 3rd day, the faucet of the bath tub was broken. Since I stayed there for my business, I had to hurry up. I couldn't turn off the faucet for 2 hours. So, they gave me another room to use the restroom which is at the end of the building and my room was at the another end of the building. It took around to 5 minutes to walk for washing my hands. 5) There were dead cockroaches in the refrigerator and some parts(dial) was broken. It didn't work well, and I complained about that to the old man who I mentioned early. He said that the only thing he could do was that he could leave message for maintenance. Also, he said he would look for the dial. However, he did not gave me new dial. Also, he did not leave message. I will never recommend this dirty and uncomfortable hotel."

It was good to have a balcony, I would recommend to ask for the second floor, you can keep the balcony door open and don't use air conditioner all the time. This place is close to Hyannis and other cute places with great seafood restaurants. We were impressed by Heritage park in Sandwich and would highly recommend to visit it if you like nature. Chattam has a very interesting port and lighthouse. Hotel personnel is very friendly, Lisa gave a lot of helpful information. If you don't have a coffeemaker, ask it at front desk. In general a lot of great memories and happy with this very convenient and affordable place."

The hotel is starting to show its age and use but it appears that the new owners are starting to work on that and improve the overall appearance of the place.

8040 Oliver Rd,"Hotel,Hotels",Erie,US,Solstice,3,"We were looking for an overnight place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids. We picked this hotel because of the great rate and the fact that it had an indoor pool. The staff was friendly and the room was as advertised. But the pool - Oh, my! One look at the color of the water and we were out of there. It did not appear to have been cleaned or filtered in a few days and there was an unpleasant odor. There is no hot tub in the pool area, either (the online picture of the pool had a picture of a separate area behind the pool with a hand rail, which I thought to be a hot tub. I don't see that picture of the pool anymore, though)."

I booked a room several days in advance for a wedding I was attending and I was told there would not be a cancellation fee - no need to do anything. I had a severe allergic reaction and was not able to attend. I didn't think anything of it until I received by credit card bill with a charge of 132.00!! When I called, the front desk lady/manager Diane was extremely rude and told me there was no way her employee would have told me that there was no cancellation fee. When I told her maybe the employee made a mistake, she said there was no way he would make that mistake and called me a liar. When I stated that sometimes employees make mistakes and I was positive I had asked about cancel fees, she said that was impossible and that I was wrong and every single hotel in the entire world(!!) charges cancellation fees. After a heated argument, I asked for the corporate number to make a complaint. I explained to the corporate office that I had been sick and was unable to attend and had been given no indication that there would be a cancellation charge (full cost for the over priced room). She was very nice and sympathetic and I confirmed that I could get a doctors note proving I was ill. She said that the Hotel owner or GM would call me to discuss and I would possibly have to provide the doctors note. That was over a week ago and I haven't heard from anyone. I will never stay at any H.I. Express ever. Be sure to stay away from Diane at this location--Rudest woman on the face of the earth."

135 Route 28,Hotels,West Yarmouth,US,Tidewater Inn,1,"I booked a room through Expedia for 2 nights at this hotel. I decided I wanted a third night, so I called the hotel directly to ask if our room would be available on Friday. I was told it was available and that I did not need to give a credit card number to hold the reservation. When I checked in at the hotel on Wednesday, my two-day Expedia reservation was fine, but there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week. I was very upset that I had just driven hours to find out my vacation was compromised. I was also pretty angry, and expressed this to the hotel owner, demanding that he honor my need for a room on Friday because his employee failed to reserve the room for me. He felt that I was making a scene, and threatened to cancel my Expedia reservation, saying I could find somewhere else to stay. I didn't want to lose my entire vacation, so when he vaguely promised to find me another room for Friday, I thanked him. There aren't enough characters allowed to go describe everything that happened in my three days there. The worst of it was, when we finally settled the Friday night room situation, we ended up getting locked out of our room by the hotel, claiming it wasn't paid for. The owner put the reservation for the night under his own name, and he himself processed my credit card on Wednesday when I checked in, yet his staff claimed it wasn't there. The Tidewater Inn nearly ruined my only vacation this year. Do not stay there!!!!"

Service could be better - concierge didn't give us the wi-fi log in at check in; we had to call to get it. Guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu - not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were. The restaurant opens at 7 and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive. The first thing the waitress told us when we walked in was that she just seated a large party and it was going to be a while. Then she left.

No cream for coffee. Hopefully this is just attributable to change in ownership. The beds were good though the room was okay and the staff tried. They were just understaffed.

14585 Duval Rd,"Hotels,Hotel",Jacksonville,US,Jacksonville Plaza Hotel and Suites,2,"We chose this hotel because it got fairly good reviews on Expedia and we needed a place to stay near the airport for an early morning flight. The room was much smaller than anticipated the bathroom was tiny with bath towels that were thin and so undersized that they were only slightly larger than hand towels. The room was clean,however, and we slept ok. Our biggest complaint was that we did not get the wake-up call we asked for and the airport shuttle was more than 15 minutes late. The person at the front desk was dismissive, saying that she ordered the call and that was all she could do and that the shuttle driver would be there. Thank heavens we woke on our own and had given ourself a 30 minute cushion in addition to the two hours that we had planned for our international flight. We do not recommend this hotel.

The room was dirty, the curtains had holes, there wasn't any toilet paper or soap or shampoo. There were only three towels for 4 people. When I checked in, the desk clerk was more interested in talking on the phone or paying for his pizza that showed up after I had been standing there for a few minutes. Our phone in the room didn't work, so when we used our cell phone to call the front desk to get some toilet paper, the desk clerk acted like we were inconveniencing him. There was a train going all night. We decided to cut our stay short, and when I went to checkout, I had to wait 5 minutes for someone to help me, when no one showed up, I had to call the hotel to get someone to come down.

As I was sleeping right next to it, and I am also a very light sleeper...turned it off one night, and then no problems to sleep.

Breakfast is good for being FREE but I would rather eat at many of the great restaurants...courtyard area is nice as is the bar. they also have no security and the rooms doors face out anyone can't just walk in and out on this property. The street where the hotel sits is under major construction so lobby and bar are covered in dust. Staff of the hotel were good allowed me to check in early.

I was asked about my stay and if there was anything they could do to improve my stay....honestly....no. **I'd like to add that my husband and I were a bit worried about our young children making noise.

It was clean enough, but there were corners and crannies that obviously have never seen a mop or vacuum. The bedding was very thin and the mattresses and pillows weren't very comfortable at all. It's a low frills room so I didn't expect to get blown away, but I did expect the fundamentals to be strong for the price. For other amenities, WiFi was artificially slowed so they can upsell on faster experience, so be aware. Utensils were available, but you have to ask, it would have been more welcoming to have them in the cabinets. Overall not a terrible experience, just kind of forgettable and didn't really make me feel I got a good value.

I had just flown in and lost my phone at the TSA check in the airport from where I took off, so I was a bit agitated. I explained my dilemma and although I was extremely early they did their best to get a room available and gave me directions to the t-mobile store so I could get a replacement phone. By the time I returned the room was ready and the woman who checked me in had a message from my wife and she read it aloud to me in such a nice way. I was really impressed by the welcome and all the help. The room was nicely decorated and I was just looking to take a shower and relax a bit before I went to meet up with some friends. And there it was... black mold in the shower. Clearly visible and of course once I saw it I looked under some of the fixtures in the shower and found a lot more. Gross. Other than that the room was basically very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Television worked well. Free WiFi was a treat. Outlets galore for your cell phones, tablets, laptops etc. Really efficient room. Pool was nice. Fitness room was clean and modern facilities. It was so difficult to actually get someone to assist you in the restaurant that I walked out twice and found someplace else to eat. That and the black mold were the only negative aspects. I would definitely stay there again. Oh and the self parking made for easy mobility if you rent a car. If not, use uber as the cab cost 3x more."

There is definitely not frills here but it's a clean, comfortable room with all the basics you need such as comfortable beds, WI-fi, tub/shower, separate area with sink outside of bathroom (which I love), small fridge, blow dryer, shampoo and lotion. The tv is old, but worked fine. The Wi-Fi also worked great. You can walk down the road 0.8 miles to a nice little beach, not good for swimming but perfect for a night time rondevous to just sit and watch the water/fireworks/moon, etc. All hotel personnel were polite and efficient, especially considering it was 4th of July on Cape Cod!! The outdoor swimming pool is perfect, we really enjoyed that one morning. Our only complaint is that the walls are paper thin, you can hear someone sneeze in the next room like they are right in the room with you. There really isn't anything you can do about that though, especially when the hotel is sold out. If you're traveling on a budget and just want a good place to sleep, shower, relax at the pool then this is what you're looking for. Oh, and there is free morning coffee in their on-site diner!"

It got taken care of about a week before my actual wedding, which was just a little too late. Communication was a bit difficult to through email and phone, but improved once it got closer to the wedding. Even though we had these issues, the day of the wedding made those issues obsolete.

Since I was not happy about that, he then checked to see what he could do and found a room with a king bed. Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home. I told the girl at the desk about the issue so hopefully the room was properly cleaned and treated.
