## Project Instructions
-	Select any one of the above project types for your final term project. After that, find an appropriate dataset for your project. Instead of that, you can collect your data using scraping.
-	Apply the text processing steps (learned in the classes) to the text of your dataset, which you will cluster.
-	Calculate TF-IDF.
-	Apply three clustering algorithms: K-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN.
-	Use PCA to reduce the features for better cluster visualization.
-	Interpret the conclusion of your result using Visualization.

## Project Deliverables						
-	You will submit the implemented R programs and supporting files (see below). During the VIVA session, you will bring the programs, and we may ask you to execute them.
-	“ids_final_dataset_sample_group_XX.csv” - your dataset file with some sample data.
-	“ids_final_project_group_XX.r” - program file of your project.
-	“ids_final_project_group_XX.pdf” - report of your project. 
-	Make a ZIP file of all the files and finally submit only the ZIP file named “ids_final_project_group_XX.zip.”
-	Replace “XX” in the filenames with your group number such as for group-1, the ZIP file name will be “ids_final_project_group_01.r.”
